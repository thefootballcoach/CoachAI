# Custom Domain Setup with Vercel

## Domain Compatibility
✅ **Your custom domain works perfectly with Vercel**
- Any domain you own (.com, .net, .org, .co.uk, etc.)
- Subdomain support (app.yourdomain.com, coaching.yourdomain.com)
- Multiple domains pointing to same app
- Automatic SSL certificates (free)

## Setup Process (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Deploy to Vercel
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Deploy app (gets temporary vercel.app URL)
3. Verify everything works

### Step 2: Add Custom Domain
1. Go to Vercel dashboard → Project → Settings → Domains
2. Add your custom domain (e.g., yourcoachingapp.com)
3. Vercel provides DNS configuration

### Step 3: Update DNS Settings
At your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.):
- **Option A:** Change nameservers to Vercel (easiest)
- **Option B:** Add CNAME record pointing to Vercel

### Step 4: SSL Certificate
- Automatic free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
- HTTPS enforced by default
- No configuration needed

## Domain Examples
- `yourcoachingapp.com` → Your main app
- `api.yourcoachingapp.com` → API subdomain (if needed)
- `www.yourcoachingapp.com` → Redirects to main domain

## Benefits vs Replit Domains
- **Professional branding** (no .replit.app suffix)
- **Better SEO** (your domain, not subdomain)
- **Email integration** (info@yourcoachingapp.com)
- **Faster performance** (global CDN)
- **Free SSL** (automatic renewal)

## Cost
- **Domain usage on Vercel:** Free
- **SSL certificate:** Free
- **Your domain registration:** Whatever you currently pay (~$10-15/year)

## Migration Impact
- **Zero downtime** - set up new domain, then switch DNS
- **Keep existing domain** - just point it to new hosting
- **Email unchanged** - if you have email on domain, it's unaffected
