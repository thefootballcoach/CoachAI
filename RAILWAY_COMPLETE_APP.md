## Step 2: Environment Variables for Railway

Set these in your Railway dashboard under "Variables":

```

## Step 3: Railway Configuration Files

Keep these files for Railway optimization:

**railway.json**
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 3
  }
}
```

**nixpacks.toml**
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs_20", "npm", "ffmpeg"]

[phases.install]
cmds = ["npm install --legacy-peer-deps --no-audit --no-fund"]

[start]
cmd = "npm start"

[variables]
NODE_ENV = "production"
