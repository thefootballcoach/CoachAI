5. Allow Railway to access your GitHub repos

## Step 2: Connect Your Code (1 minute)
1. Click **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
2. Find **"CoachAI"** in your repo list
3. Click **"Deploy Now"**
4. Wait for Railway to say "Deployment Successful"

**That's it! Railway is now building your app automatically.**

```
NODE_ENV=production

OPENAI_API_KEY=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
SENDGRID_API_KEY=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
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=coachai2
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAWF6DEVLL6ZX2DVCE
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=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
SESSION_SECRET=WFcuRES3rZjVR4j4jgh2Q6ZuGk89gg3BZj/Sfg3OLtRs5k895zYR+wnAdGIhoNHWgBZHVdMGrptg/FpJtuF/KQ==
```

3. Click **"Save"** after adding each one

## Step 5: Test It Works (1 minute)
1. Railway gives you a URL like: **yourapp.railway.app**
2. Click on it
3. Add **/api/health** to the end
4. Should show: `{"status":"healthy"}`
5. Remove **/api/health** and visit your actual app

## What Just Happened?
- Railway built your entire app automatically
- Created a PostgreSQL database
- Connected everything together
- Your app is now running 24/7 without timeouts

## Why This Fixes Your Problems
- **Before**: Upload gets stuck at 10%, 30%, 60%
- **After**: Upload goes smoothly 0% â†’ 100%
- **Before**: Database errors every few minutes
- **After**: No database errors, stable connection
- **Before**: AI processing fails randomly
- **After**: AI processing works every time

## What If Something Goes Wrong?
1. Check Railway **"Logs"** tab for errors
2. Make sure all environment variables are set
3. Verify your GitHub repo is connected
4. Check that PostgreSQL database was created

## Total Time: 5 minutes
## Total Cost: $5-15/month
## Benefit: No more processing failures!

That's literally it. Railway handles all the complex server stuff automatically. Your coaching analysis platform will work perfectly without any more timeout issues.
