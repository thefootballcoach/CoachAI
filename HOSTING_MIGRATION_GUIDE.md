# Hosting Migration Guide for CoachAI

## Current Issues with Replit
- Videos getting stuck at various processing stages (10%, 30%, 60%)
- Serverless timeouts interrupting AI processing
- Memory limitations for large file processing
- Unpredictable cold starts affecting long-running tasks

## Quick Fix: Stay on Replit
If you want to continue on Replit temporarily, we can:
1. Implement a job queue system (Redis/Bull)
2. Process videos in smaller chunks
3. Add more aggressive timeout recovery
4. Use external AI processing service

## Environment Variables to Transfer
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG...
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=...
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
SESSION_SECRET=...
```

## Files to Deploy
- All source code (client/, server/, shared/)
- package.json dependencies
- Database migrations (if using Drizzle)
- Environment configuration

## Database Migration
1. Export current PostgreSQL data
2. Import to new hosting provider's database
3. Update DATABASE_URL
4. Run migrations if needed

## Recommendation
**Railway.app** is the best choice because:
- Handles AI processing workloads excellently
- No timeout issues
- Simple migration process
- Cost-effective
- Built specifically for full-stack apps like yours

Would you like me to help you migrate to Railway, or would you prefer to implement a queue system to stay on Replit?
