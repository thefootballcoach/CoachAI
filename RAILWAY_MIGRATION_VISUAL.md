## "Upload from Local Directory" - Where to Find It

### Step 1: Go to Railway Dashboard
- Visit: https://railway.app/dashboard
- Click on your "CoachAI" project

### Step 2: Find the Deploy Button
Look for one of these options in your service dashboard:

**Option A: Main Deploy Button**
- Look for a purple "Deploy" button in the main dashboard
- Click it and you'll see deployment options

**Option B: Settings Method**
- Click "Settings" tab
- Look for "Source" section
- Click "Disconnect" next to GitHub
- Then a "Deploy" or "Upload" option will appear

**Option C: Three Dots Menu**
- Look for three dots (...) menu in your service
- Click it to see "Deploy" options
- Select deployment method

### Step 3: Upload Options
Once you find the deploy area, you'll see:
- "Connect Repository" (GitHub/GitLab)
- "Upload Directory" or "Upload from Local"
- "Deploy from Local Directory"

**Click the "Upload Directory" or "Deploy from Local Directory" option**

### Step 4: File Upload
- A file picker window will open
- Select your project folder (as ZIP file)
- Or drag and drop the folder directly

## Alternative Method
If you can't find the upload option:

1. **Disconnect GitHub first**:
   - Settings > Source > Disconnect
2. **New Deploy button will appear**:
   - This gives you upload options

The Railway interface sometimes varies, but the upload option will be available once GitHub is disconnected.
