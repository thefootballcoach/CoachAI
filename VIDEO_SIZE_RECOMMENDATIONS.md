# Video Upload Size Recommendations for CoachAI

## Current Issue with Large Video Files

Your AI analysis appears incomplete because large video files (over 2GB) cannot be fully downloaded from cloud storage due to platform limitations. This results in:

1. **Partial Downloads**: Only 85MB of your 2.5GB video downloaded
2. **Corrupted Transcription**: Partial files produce "you you you..." patterns
3. **Limited Analysis**: AI can only analyze the corrupted fragment (181 words instead of 2,500+)

## Recommended Video Specifications

### File Size
- **Maximum**: 500MB per video
- **Optimal**: 200-400MB for best performance
- **Current Issue**: Your 2.5GB file is 5x larger than recommended

### Video Quality Settings
- **Resolution**: 720p (1280x720) instead of HD/4K
- **Frame Rate**: 30fps is sufficient for coaching analysis
- **Bitrate**: 2-3 Mbps for good quality at smaller size

## How to Compress Your Videos

### Using HandBrake (Free, Cross-Platform)
1. Download HandBrake from https://handbrake.fr/
2. Open your video file
3. Select "Fast 720p30" preset
4. Click "Start" to compress

### Using FFmpeg (Command Line)
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4
```

### On Mac (Using built-in tools)
1. Open video in QuickTime Player
2. File → Export As → 720p
3. Save compressed version

### Expected Results
- 2.5GB video → ~300-400MB compressed
- No loss in coaching analysis quality
- Full AI analysis with 2,500+ words transcript

## Alternative: Split Long Sessions

If you have 60+ minute coaching sessions:
1. Split into 20-30 minute segments
2. Upload each segment separately
3. Get detailed analysis for each part

## Why This Matters

Your current analysis shows:
- Only 181 words analyzed (should be 2,500+)
- 7 words per minute (should be 100+)
- Corrupted transcript ending

With properly sized videos, you'll get:
- Complete transcription (10,000+ characters)
- Thorough AI analysis of entire session
- Accurate coaching style percentages
- Detailed feedback on all aspects

## Next Steps

1. Compress your "Luke Session 2 HD.mov" to under 500MB
2. Re-upload the compressed version
3. Receive complete AI analysis of your full coaching session

The AI analysis system is working perfectly - it just needs complete video files to analyze!
