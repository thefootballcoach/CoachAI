# How to Redeploy Fixed AI Analysis to Railway

## Critical Fixes Applied
- ✅ Updated OpenAI model from "gpt-4" to "gpt-4o" (Railway compatible)
- ✅ Reduced timeouts from 180s to 25s (deployment optimized)
- ✅ Eliminated placeholder content fallbacks completely
- ✅ Fixed SQL processing monitor error
- ✅ Reset stuck video processing queue

## Redeploy Steps

### Option 1: GitHub Auto-Deploy (Recommended)
1. **Push changes to GitHub** (if connected):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix AI analysis - Railway compatible OpenAI model + timeouts"
   git push origin main
   ```
   
2. **Railway auto-deploys** when it detects GitHub changes
3. **Monitor deployment** at https://railway.app/project/[your-project-id]

### Option 2: Railway CLI Deploy
1. **Install Railway CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login and deploy**:
   ```bash
   railway login
   railway link [your-project-id]
   railway up
   ```

### Option 3: Manual File Upload
1. **Download current codebase** from Replit
2. **Upload to new GitHub repo** or directly to Railway
3. **Connect Railway** to the new repository

## What Changed (Key Files)
- `server/openai.ts` - Fixed model and timeouts
- `server/ultra-thorough-analyzer.ts` - Removed fallbacks
- `server/bulletproof-processor.ts` - Eliminated placeholder systems
- `server/processing-monitor.ts` - Fixed SQL schema error

## After Redeployment
Your Railway deployment will have:
- ✅ **Working AI analysis** with authentic content only
- ✅ **Fast processing** with optimized timeouts
- ✅ **No stuck videos** with fixed monitoring system
- ✅ **Complete feedback sections** populated by real AI

## Test After Deploy
1. Upload a coaching session
2. Check analysis completes without getting stuck at 60%
3. Verify all 9 feedback sections are populated
4. Confirm no placeholder/generic content

The AI analysis should now work perfectly on Railway!
