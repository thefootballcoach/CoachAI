# Railway Dashboard Deploy Fix

## Current Status
- https://coaches-ai.com is working (HTTP 200)
- But Railway shows build errors with npm install
- This means current deployment is working but new deployments will fail

## Simple Fix
Use Railway's dashboard to deploy directly instead of GitHub integration:

### Step 1: Go to Railway Dashboard
1. Go to https://railway.app/project/[your-project-id]
2. Click on your CoachAI service

### Step 2: Deploy from Local Files
1. Click "Deploy from GitHub" dropdown
2. Select "Deploy from local files"
3. Upload your project folder as a ZIP file

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Railway dashboard:
- DATABASE_URL
- OPENAI_API_KEY  
- SESSION_SECRET
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME
- SENDGRID_API_KEY

### Step 4: Set Build Command
In Railway dashboard settings:
- Build Command: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- Start Command: `npm start`

## Alternative: Keep Current Working Version
Since https://coaches-ai.com is working:
- Don't trigger new deployments
- Current version is stable
- Only deploy when you need to update features

## Why This Happens
The GitHub integration is trying to use a Dockerfile that has npm install issues. Direct deployment or local file upload bypasses this problem.

Your platform is working - the build errors are just preventing new deployments.
