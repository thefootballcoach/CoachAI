# Railway Migration - Final Success Steps

## Current Status
✅ **https://coaches-ai.com is working perfectly**
❌ **GitHub integration failing at npm install**

## Immediate Solution
Switch to manual deployment to fix future updates:

### Step 1: Download Clean Project
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Disconnect GitHub integration in Settings > Source
3. Download this project as ZIP (exclude the files listed in .railwayignore)

### Step 2: Manual Deploy
1. In Railway dashboard, click "Deploy" 
2. Select "Upload from Local Directory"
3. Upload the clean ZIP file
4. Set build command: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps --no-audit`
5. Set start command: `npm start`

### Step 3: Environment Variables
Verify these exist in Railway:
- DATABASE_URL
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- SESSION_SECRET
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME
- SENDGRID_API_KEY
