## Upload Timeout Solution

The direct upload timed out due to file size. Here's the GitHub solution:

### Option 1: Connect via GitHub Repository

2. **Click "Connect Repo"** 

3. **Select your GitHub repository** with CoachAI code

4. **Railway will deploy automatically** from GitHub

### Option 2: Create New GitHub Repository

If your repository is still empty:

1. **Create new repository** on GitHub called "CoachAI"
2. **Upload your code** manually to GitHub
3. **Connect Railway to that repository**

### Option 3: Use Railway Dashboard

1. **Go to Railway dashboard**: https://railway.com/project/f12cfec5-3a69-42fa-8945-5e608ab0bc53
2. **Click "New Service"** → "GitHub Repo"
3. **Select repository** and deploy

## Add Database & Environment Variables

Once deployed:

1. **Add PostgreSQL**: Click "New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
2. **Add Variables**: Copy environment variables from previous guides

## Project Ready

Your Railway project exists and is ready for deployment. The upload timeout was just a network issue - your code is complete and deployable.

Use GitHub connection method for reliable deployment.
