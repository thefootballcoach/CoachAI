# Alternative Ways to Get Your Files

## Method 1: Create GitHub Repository Directly from Replit

### Step 1: Connect GitHub to Replit
1. In Replit, look for a **"Connect to GitHub"** button or option
2. This is usually in the sidebar or top menu
3. Authorize Replit to access your GitHub account

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
1. Once connected, look for **"Push to GitHub"** 
2. Create a new repository directly from Replit
3. This uploads your code automatically

## Method 2: Manual File Copy Method

### Step 1: View Individual Files
1. Click on the **Files** tab on the left
2. Right-click individual important files
3. Copy the content manually

### Key Files to Copy:
- `package.json`
- `vercel.json` 
- All files in `client/` folder
- All files in `server/` folder
- All files in `shared/` folder

### Step 2: Create Files in GitHub
1. Go to GitHub.com
2. Create new repository
3. Use "Create new file" to recreate each file
4. Paste the content

## Method 3: Use Replit's Git Integration

### If Git is Available:
1. Look for **"Git"** tab in Replit
2. Click **"Push to GitHub"**
3. Follow the prompts

## Method 4: Copy-Paste Essential Code

### Create these files on GitHub manually:

**package.json** (copy from your Replit)
**vercel.json** (already created)
**Client folder contents** (React app)
**Server folder contents** (Express app)

Don't worry about the `scripts/` folder - that's what was causing the deployment issues anyway.
