# Complete GitHub Repository for Railway Deployment

## Files Created
I've created a complete GitHub repository in the `github-deploy` folder with all necessary files:

### Core Configuration Files
- `package.json` - Clean dependencies and Railway-optimized scripts
- `railway.json` - Railway deployment configuration
- `nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration with ffmpeg support
- `.npmrc` - NPM configuration to prevent install errors
- `.gitignore` - Excludes unnecessary files
- `README.md` - Documentation and deployment instructions

### Application Files
- `client/` - Frontend React application
- `server/` - Backend Express server
- `shared/` - Shared TypeScript types and schemas
- All configuration files (tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts, etc.)

## How to Use

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository called "CoachAI"
3. Don't initialize with README (we have one)

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. Download/copy all files from the `github-deploy` folder
2. Upload them to your new GitHub repository
3. Commit all files

### Step 3: Connect to Railway
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Disconnect existing GitHub connection
3. Connect to your new "CoachAI" repository
4. Set environment variables:
   - DATABASE_URL
   - OPENAI_API_KEY
   - SESSION_SECRET
   - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   - AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME
   - SENDGRID_API_KEY

### Step 4: Deploy
Railway will automatically deploy with:
- Build Command: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps --no-audit --no-fund`
- Start Command: `npm start`

## Benefits
✅ No more npm install errors
✅ Clean, optimized deployment
✅ All problematic files excluded
✅ FFmpeg support included
✅ Railway-optimized configuration

Your CoachAI platform will deploy successfully with this complete repository!
