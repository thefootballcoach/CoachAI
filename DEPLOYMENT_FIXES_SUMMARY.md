# Deployment Fixes Summary

## 413 Request Entity Too Large Error

### Problem
Upload works in preview but fails in deployment with "413 Request Entity Too Large" error.

### Root Cause
Deployment uses nginx proxy with different limits than preview's direct Express server.

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Enhanced Nginx Configuration
- Increased `client_max_body_size` from 6G to 8G
- Extended timeouts to 600s
- Added `client_body_in_file_only clean` for large file handling
- Increased `proxy_max_temp_file_size` to 8192m

#### 2. Node.js Server Optimization
- Increased `maxHeaderSize` to 32MB
- Enhanced NODE_OPTIONS with larger memory allocation
- Disabled all timeout restrictions

#### 3. AI Analysis Deployment Compatibility
- Reduced OpenAI timeout to 25 seconds
- Streamlined response structure
- Implemented fallback analysis system
- Maintained category-specific detailed feedback

### Status
Both upload system and AI analysis now work reliably in deployed environment while maintaining full 6GB upload capability and comprehensive coaching feedback.
