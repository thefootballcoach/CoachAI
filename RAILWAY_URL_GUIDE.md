# Railway URL Access Guide

## Problem: Cannot Access Deployment URL

Your Railway deployment is successful, but you need to find the correct URL to access your CoachAI platform.

## Solution: Find Your Railway URL

### Step 1: Access Railway Dashboard
1. Go to: https://railway.app/project/f12cfec5-3a69-42fa-8945-5e608ab0bc53
2. You should see your CoachAI project

### Step 2: Find the Deployment URL
1. Click on your main service (usually labeled "web" or similar)
2. Look for the **"Deployments"** tab
3. Find the latest successful deployment (should be green/active)
4. Look for the deployment URL - it's usually displayed as a clickable link

### Step 3: Alternative Method
1. In your service dashboard, go to **"Settings"** tab
2. Look for **"Domains"** section
3. Your public URL should be listed there

### Step 4: Manual URL Construction
If the URL isn't visible, Railway URLs typically follow this pattern:
- `https://[service-name]-production-[random-hash].up.railway.app`
- `https://web-production-[random-hash].up.railway.app`

## Common Issues & Solutions

### URL Not Working
- **Check deployment status**: Must be green/active
- **Verify port binding**: App should listen on Railway's PORT variable
- **Check logs**: Look for startup errors in deployment logs

### Service Not Responding
- **Check environment variables**: All 7 variables must be set
- **Verify health endpoint**: /api/health should respond
- **Check resource limits**: Ensure deployment has adequate memory

## Expected Result
Once you access the correct URL, you should see:
- CoachAI login page
- Ability to register/login
- Access to coaching dashboard
- Upload functionality working
- AI analysis processing successfully

## Next Steps
1. Copy the deployment URL from Railway dashboard
2. Test login with your credentials
3. Verify all features are working
4. Your CoachAI platform is ready for use!

The deployment is successful - you just need to find the correct Railway-generated URL.
