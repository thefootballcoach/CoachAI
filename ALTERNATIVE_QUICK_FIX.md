# Alternative: Create New Zip with Fixed Configuration

## Option 1: I'll Create a Fixed Version for You

Let me create a new zip with the correct vercel.json configuration:

### Steps:
1. I'll fix the vercel.json file
2. Create a new zip with the correct configuration
3. You download and deploy that instead

## Option 2: Manual Fix (If You Have File Access)

### On Your Computer:
1. Extract CoachAIfeedback.zip
2. Open vercel.json in any text editor
3. Replace content with the fixed version
4. Upload folders to GitHub
5. Deploy to Vercel

## Option 3: Direct File Upload to GitHub

### Skip the zip entirely:
1. Go to GitHub â†’ New repository
2. Click "Upload files"
3. Download CoachAIfeedback.zip
4. Extract it
5. Drag the extracted folders directly to GitHub
6. Fix vercel.json in GitHub's web editor
7. Deploy

Which option works best for you?
