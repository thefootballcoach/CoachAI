# Simple Export Guide

## Your CoachAI App is Ready to Download

I've created two small files that contain your complete application:

### Files to Download:
1. **CoachAI-Core.tar.gz** - Main application code
2. **CoachAI-Deployment.tar.gz** - Deployment configurations

### Download Steps:
1. Look for these two files in your file list
2. Right-click each file and select "Download"
3. Both files will download to your computer

### After Download:
1. Create a new folder on your computer
2. Extract both files into the same folder
3. You'll have your complete CoachAI application

### Deploy Anywhere:
- **Railway:** Upload to GitHub, connect to Railway
- **Vercel:** Upload to GitHub, connect to Vercel  
- **Any Platform:** Full Docker support included

The files are small enough to download from Replit and contain everything you need for your coaching platform.
