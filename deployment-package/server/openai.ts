'Integrate the video frame analysis insights with the transcript analysis for a comprehensive multimodal assessment.' : ''}

            ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
            
            1. ULTRA-DETAILED AUTHENTIC CONTENT ANALYSIS
            - Analyze EVERY DETAIL demonstrated in this specific transcript with forensic precision
            - Identify ALL player names, EVERY tactical instruction, ALL communication patterns with frequency counts
            - Reference 15+ specific quotes and behaviors observed in the session with timestamps/context
            - Analyze word choice, tone indicators, instruction sequencing, and communication patterns
            - Extract ALL technical terms used and evaluate their appropriateness and accuracy
            
            2. COMPREHENSIVE INTERACTION vs INTERVENTION ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)
            Distinguish between two types of coach-player communication with detailed breakdown:
            
            INTERACTIONS (COUNT EVERY INSTANCE): Every time coach speaks with/to a player including:
            - General encouragement ("well done", "good job", "keep going", "nice work")
            - Basic acknowledgments ("yes", "okay", "right", "good")
            - Simple motivational comments ("come on", "let's go", "keep it up")
            - General praise without specific feedback ("excellent", "brilliant", "fantastic")
            - Social/relationship building communication ("how are you feeling?", name usage)
            - Positive reinforcement statements without instructional content
            
            INTERVENTIONS (COUNT EVERY COACHING MOMENT): Specific coaching feedback moments including:
            - Technical corrections ("keep your head up when passing", "plant your standing foot")
            - Tactical instructions ("move into space behind the defender", "track the runner")
            - Specific skill feedback ("follow through with your shooting foot", "use the inside of your foot")
            - Performance guidance ("check your shoulders before receiving", "scan for options")
            - Corrective coaching ("slow down your first touch", "improve your first touch")
            - Strategic direction ("support your teammate on the left", "create width in attack")
            - Positional coaching ("hold your line", "squeeze up", "drop deeper")
            
            Provide EXACT counts for each type and calculate precise intervention ratio (interventions/total interactions)
            This ratio reveals coaching depth vs general communication quality.
            
            3. UNPRECEDENTED MULTI-DIMENSIONAL ANALYTICAL DEPTH
            Perform comprehensive analysis through multiple analytical passes:
            
            PASS 1 - CONTENT EXTRACTION:
            - Extract ALL player names mentioned in transcript
            - Count ALL questions asked (including rhetorical questions)
            - Identify ALL tactical instructions and technical corrections
            - Record ALL instances of positive reinforcement
            - Note ALL corrective feedback moments with context
            
            PASS 2 - LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS:
            - Analyze sentence complexity and vocabulary sophistication
            - Assess age-appropriate language usage throughout session
            - Evaluate technical terminology accuracy and usage
            - Review communication clarity, specificity, and instruction flow
            
            PASS 3 - PEDAGOGICAL ASSESSMENT:
            - Examine skill progression sequences and learning scaffolding
            - Analyze demonstration techniques and instructional methods
            - Review feedback timing, relevance, and effectiveness
            - Assess alignment between intended and actual learning objectives
            
            PASS 4 - ENGAGEMENT EVALUATION:
            - Map individual player interaction patterns and frequency
            - Analyze motivational language effectiveness and variety
            - Review inclusion strategies ensuring all players are engaged
            - Assess emotional tone, atmosphere creation, and relationship building
            
            2. COACHING STYLE IDENTIFICATION
            Analyze and identify the dominant coaching styles demonstrated:
            - AUTOCRATIC: Direct commands, rigid control, one-way communication
            - DEMOCRATIC: Shared decision-making, player input, collaborative approach
            - GUIDED DISCOVERY: Questions to lead learning, problem-solving focus
            - COMMAND STYLE: Direct instruction, demonstration-practice model
            - RECIPROCAL: Peer teaching, partner work emphasis
            - LAISSEZ-FAIRE: Minimal intervention, player autonomy
            Provide percentages for each style based on observed behaviors.
            
            3. COMPREHENSIVE CATEGORY ASSESSMENT
            For each category, provide:
            - Specific strengths demonstrated (with transcript evidence)
            - Targeted development areas (with examples from session)
            - Academic references relevant to observed behaviors
            - Practical recommendations based on what actually occurred
            
            3. ACADEMIC INTEGRATION
            Reference specific research from:
            - Sports psychology (motivation, learning theory)
            - Coaching pedagogy (instruction methods, feedback theory)
            - Football-specific research (tactical development, skill acquisition)
            - Communication theory (clarity, engagement, language use)
            
            4. PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS
            - Base all suggestions on actual coaching behaviors observed
            - Provide specific examples from the transcript
            - Reference coaching methods that would improve demonstrated weaknesses
            - Suggest academic resources relevant to their specific needs
            
            5. DETAILED SCORING RATIONALE
            Explain each score (1-10) with:
            - Specific evidence from transcript
            - Comparison to coaching best practices
            - Clear improvement pathways
            
            6. LANGUAGE ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS
            Calculate specific scores based on actual transcript content:
            - CLARITY (1-10): Assess sentence structure, vocabulary complexity, instruction flow
            - SPECIFICITY (1-10): Measure concrete vs vague language, actionable vs general feedback
            - AGE APPROPRIATE (1-10): Evaluate vocabulary level, complexity for target age group
            Provide detailed analysis with specific examples from transcript for each metric.
