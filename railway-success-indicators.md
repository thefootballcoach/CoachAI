## How to Verify Migration Success

### 1. Deployment Health Check

{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-17T...",
  "environment": "production",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### 2. Upload Processing Test
1. Login to your coaching platform
2. Upload a test video/audio file
3. **Success indicators:**
   - âœ… File uploads without timeout
   - âœ… Processing goes from 0% â†’ 30% â†’ 60% â†’ 100% smoothly
   - âœ… No stuck processing at any stage
   - âœ… AI analysis completes successfully
   - âœ… Feedback appears with all sections populated

### 3. Database Connectivity
- User login/registration works
- Video metadata saves correctly
- Analysis results persist in database

### 4. S3 File Storage
- Files upload to S3 successfully
- File downloads work for playback
- No "file not found" errors

## Expected Performance Improvements

| Issue | Before (Replit) | After (Railway) |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| Processing timeouts | Frequent at 10%, 30%, 60% | None |
| Upload success rate | ~30-50% | ~95-99% |
| AI analysis completion | Often fails | Consistently succeeds |
| Background job runtime | Limited by serverless | Unlimited |
| Memory constraints | Frequent issues | No limitations |
| Cold starts | Interrupts processing | Eliminated |

## If Issues Persist After Migration

1. **Check Railway logs**: Dashboard â†’ Logs tab
2. **Verify environment variables**: All keys properly set
3. **Database connection**: Ensure DATABASE_URL is correct
4. **S3 permissions**: Verify AWS credentials work
