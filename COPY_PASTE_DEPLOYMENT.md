# Copy & Paste Deployment Solution

Since the ZIP file creation failed, here's a simple copy & paste solution:

## Option 1: Manual File Creation

### Create these files in your GitHub repository:

---

**1. package.json**
```json
{
  "name": "coachAI",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "tsx server/index.ts",
    "dev": "tsx server/index.ts",
    "build": "echo 'No build required'"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.21.1",
    "tsx": "^4.19.2",
    "typescript": "^5.7.2",
    "openai": "^4.71.0",
    "@aws-sdk/client-s3": "3.832.0",
    "@neondatabase/serverless": "^0.10.4",
    "drizzle-orm": "^0.36.4",
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
    "vite": "^6.0.3"
  }
}
```

**2. railway.json**
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start"
  }
}
```

**3. nixpacks.toml**
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs_20", "npm", "ffmpeg"]

[phases.install]
cmds = ["npm install --legacy-peer-deps --no-audit"]

[start]
cmd = "npm start"
```

**4. .npmrc**
```
legacy-peer-deps=true
audit=false
fund=false
```

---

## Option 2: Use Railway CLI

Instead of GitHub, use Railway CLI:

1. **Install Railway CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login and Deploy**
   ```bash
   railway login
   railway link
   railway up
   ```

This uploads your current project directly to Railway, bypassing GitHub entirely.

## Option 3: Download from File Manager

1. Go to your file manager/file browser
2. Look for **CoachAI-Github-Deploy.tar.gz**
3. Download and extract it
4. Upload to GitHub

The tar.gz file contains your complete optimized repository ready for Railway deployment.
