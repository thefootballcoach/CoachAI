# Fix "Please log in to upload files" Error

## The Problem
You're getting "Please log in to upload files. Click the login button." when trying to upload to GitHub.

## Solution - Check These Steps

### Step 1: Verify GitHub Login
1. Go to **github.com**
2. Make sure you're logged in (see your profile picture in top right)
3. If not logged in, click "Sign in" and enter your credentials

### Step 2: Create Repository First
1. After logging in, click the **"+"** icon in top right
2. Select **"New repository"**
3. Name: `coaching-platform`
4. Set to **Private**
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 3: Upload Files
After creating the repository:
1. You should see options like "uploading an existing file"
2. Click **"uploading an existing file"**
3. Drag your extracted files or zip file
4. Add commit message: "Deploy coaching platform"
5. Click **"Commit new files"**

### Alternative: Use GitHub Desktop
If web upload still doesn't work:
1. Download **GitHub Desktop** from desktop.github.com
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Clone your repository locally
4. Copy your files into the repository folder
5. Commit and push changes

### Alternative: Command Line
If you have git installed:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coaching-platform.git
cd coaching-platform
# Copy your files here
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy coaching platform"
git push
```

## Quick Test
Try this first:
1. Go to github.com
2. Make sure you see your username in top right
3. Try creating a new repository
4. If that works, the upload should work too

The error usually means you're not fully authenticated with GitHub.
