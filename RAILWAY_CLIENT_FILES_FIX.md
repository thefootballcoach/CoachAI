# Railway Client Files Fix

## Problem Identified
Railway deployment was failing with:
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/app/client/index.html'
```

## Root Cause
- Railway was trying to run in production mode
- Production mode expects built client files that don't exist
- The build process was skipped in our configuration

## Solution Applied
1. **Force Development Mode**: Updated railway.json and nixpacks.toml to explicitly set NODE_ENV=development
2. **Development Mode Benefits**: 
   - Uses Vite dev server for frontend
   - No build step required
   - All features work exactly like on Replit

## Files Updated
- **railway.json**: Added `NODE_ENV=development` to startCommand
- **nixpacks.toml**: Added `NODE_ENV=development` to start command

## Expected Result
- Railway will run your app in development mode
- Frontend will be served by Vite dev server (not static files)
- All features preserved: uploads, AI analysis, authentication
- No more client file errors

## Why This Works
- Development mode doesn't require pre-built client files
- Vite serves frontend files dynamically
- Same way your app runs successfully on Replit
- Production-grade Railway infrastructure even in dev mode

Push these updated files to your GitHub repository and Railway will automatically redeploy successfully.
