# Super Easy Railway Fix

## Problem
Your Railway app shows an error instead of your CoachAI platform.

## Solution
Replace 3 files in your GitHub repository with the content below.

---

## Step 1: Create railway.json file
**Copy this exactly:**
```
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "NODE_ENV=development npm run dev",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 3
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Create nixpacks.toml file
**Copy this exactly:**
```
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs_20", "npm"]

[phases.install]
cmds = ["npm install --force"]

[start]
cmd = "NODE_ENV=development npm run dev"
```

## Step 3: Create .npmrc file
**Copy this exactly:**
```
legacy-peer-deps=true
force=true
audit=false
```

---

## That's It!

1. Add these 3 files to your GitHub repository
2. Railway will automatically redeploy
3. Your CoachAI platform will work

## Result
- Your app will run in development mode (like Replit)
- No more file errors
- Your CoachAI platform will be accessible

Just copy, paste, and save these 3 files in your GitHub repository.
