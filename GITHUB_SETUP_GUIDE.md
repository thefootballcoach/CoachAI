git commit -m "Initial CoachAI platform upload"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CoachAI.git

```

## Essential Files to Include
âœ… All these files are already in your project:
- `package.json` - Dependencies
- `server/` - Backend code
- `client/` - Frontend code
- `shared/` - Shared schemas
- `railway.json` - Railway configuration
- `nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration
- `Procfile` - Process definition

## After Upload
1. Go to your Railway project: https://railway.com/project/f12cfec5-3a69-42fa-8945-5e608ab0bc53
2. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your `CoachAI` repository
4. Railway will automatically deploy

## File Size Tip
If upload fails due to size:
- Exclude `node_modules/` folder (Railway will rebuild it)
- Exclude `.git/` folder if present
- Include only source code files

Your database is clean and ready for migration!
